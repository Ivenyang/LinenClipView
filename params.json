{"name":"LinenClipView","body":"**LinenClipView** provides a subclass of `NSScrollView` and `NSWebView` \r\nthat displays a linen pattern in the clip view like many of Apple's Lion apps. This library can of course be used to display any background image.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn **Interface Builder** change the *Class* of an `NSScrollView` to `LNScrollView` or similarly change the *Class* of a `WebView` to `LNWebView`.\r\n\r\nThese classes can also be created via code with `initWithFrame`.\r\n\r\nTo set the pattern image simply call `setPattern` on either subclass:\r\n\r\n``` obj-c\r\n[self.tableScrollView setPattern:[NSImage imageNamed:@\"pattern11\"]];\r\n[self.webView setPattern:[NSImage imageNamed:@\"pattern3\"]];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe sample project that ships with this project demonstrates this.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/kgn/LinenClipView/raw/master/Screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to [@Dimillian](https://twitter.com/#!/dimillian) for figuring out how to keep the \r\npattern stationary(`[NSGraphicsContext setPatternPhase:]`) and [@caffeinatedapp](https://twitter.com/#!/caffeinatedapp) for figuring out a fix to the scrollbars on Lion(the complicated `hitTest` code).\r\n\r\nThe background patterns included with this project are from [@minimalpatterns](http://www.minimal-patterns.com).\r\n\r\n**LinenClipView** is available under the MIT license.
